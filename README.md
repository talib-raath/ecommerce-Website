DBProject
I've used Oracle 19c for the database as it was the requirement of our project. You'll need to install Oracle 19c on your machine before you can run it. Dont't forget to modify the DATABASES dictionary (username, password etc) declared in the settings.py file accordingly. The SQL code to create the schema and other database stuff is in extras>inventory.sql Make sure to run the SQL code from the inventory.sql file before you run the project.
Setup:
git clone https://github.com/talib-raath/ecommerce-Website

Replace appname with the name of your app.

Configure Settings: Django settings are located in the settings.py file within your project directory. Configure database settings, static files, templates, middleware, etc., as needed for your project.
